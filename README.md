# Educational-Times
The Educational Times was a British journal published in the nineteenth century that addressed a wide variety of topics including a 
section in which readers can propose mathematical questions and submit answers to the questions that have been submitted. The intent 
for this website is to provide an online tool to search the meta-data contained in the spreadsheet that Dr. Tattersall developed.
